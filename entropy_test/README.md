===
## Description
A small HTML/JS tool to visualize and calculate the password space (i.e. entropy) of combinations of grids.

## Usage
You can run it locally by opening `index.html` in your browser.

Set the grid width and height, the total number of grids, the number of choices, and if the order of choices matters. Hit enter or click Submit to see the entropy and a quick visualization.

## Todo
- Add visualization for the choices on the grids (both number and order).
- Add clickable history
